    " Tomato Basil Chicken Recipe is a lovely chicken dish, succulent breast pieces of chicken is pan seared and dunked in a light and refreshing homemade tomato basil sauce and packed with fresh flavours from basil leaves.  ",
    " These quickly stir-fried beef bites deliver all the savory luxury of a steakhouse-caliber steak, without the stress over cooking one at home. The buttery, velvety sauce coats every piece nicely, and the vermouth's herbal richness pairs nicely with the savory Worcestershire. Serve as an appetizer with toothpicks, or enjoy over mashed potatoes or polenta. ",
